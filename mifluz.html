<p>
The purpose of mifluz is to provide a C++ library to build and query a full text inverted index. It is dynamically updatable, scalable (up to 1Tb indexes), uses a controlled amount of memory, shares index files and memory cache among processes or threads and compresses index files to 50% of the raw data. The structure of the index is configurable at runtime and allows inclusion of relevance ranking information.  The query functions do not require to load all the occurences of a searched term. They consume very few resources and many searches can be run in parallel.
<p>
Implementing a library that manages an inverted index is a very easy task when
there is a small number of words and documents. It becomes a lot harder when dealing
with a large number of words and documents. <b>mifluz</b> has been designed with
the further upper limits in mind : 500 million documents, 50 giga words, 20 million
document updates per day. 
<p>
<b>mifluz</b> has two main characteristics : it is very simple (one
might say stupid :-) and uses 50% of the size of the indexed text for
the index. It is simple because it provides only a few basic
functionalities. It does not contain document parsers (HTML, PDF
etc...). It does not contain a full text query parser. It does not
provide result display functions or other user friendly stuff. It only
provides functions to store word occurences and retrieve them. The fact
that it uses 50% of the size of the indexed text is rather
atypical. Most well known full text indexing systems only use 30%. The
advantage <b>mifluz</b> has over most full text indexing systems is that
it is fully dynamic (update, delete, insert), uses only a controled
amount of memory while resolving a query, has higher upper limits and has a 
simple storage scheme. Consuming more disk space allows all this.
